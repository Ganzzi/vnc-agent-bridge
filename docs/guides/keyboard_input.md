# Keyboard Input Guide

Comprehensive guide to keyboard input operations with VNC Agent Bridge.

## Overview

The Keyboard Controller provides:
- Text typing with character-by-character control
- Individual key presses
- Key combinations (hotkeys)
- Key hold/release events
- Support for special keys, function keys, and modifiers

## Basic Text Input

### Type Simple Text

```python
with VNCAgentBridge('localhost') as vnc:
    # Type text string
    vnc.keyboard.type_text("Hello World")
    
    # Type with delay between characters
    vnc.keyboard.type_text("Careful typing", delay=0.1)
```

### Type Special Characters

```python
with VNCAgentBridge('localhost') as vnc:
    # Email address
    vnc.keyboard.type_text("user@example.com")
    
    # URL
    vnc.keyboard.type_text("https://example.com")
    
    # Numbers and symbols
    vnc.keyboard.type_text("Phone: 555-1234")
    
    # Unicode (if supported)
    vnc.keyboard.type_text("Caf√©")
```

### Type with Timing

```python
with VNCAgentBridge('localhost') as vnc:
    # Fast typing (no delay)
    vnc.keyboard.type_text("fast", delay=0)
    
    # Slow typing (human-like)
    vnc.keyboard.type_text("slow", delay=0.15)
    
    # Very slow typing
    vnc.keyboard.type_text("very slow", delay=0.3)
```
